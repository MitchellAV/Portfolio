The traditional Japanese calendar marks the passing of the seasons and changes in the natural world through the names given to different times of year.

 There are 24 major divisions, or sekki, from Risshun (Beginning of spring) in early February until Daikan (Greater cold).

Originally taken from Chinese sources, these are still well-known around East Asia.

The 24 divisions are each split again into three for a total of 72 ko that last around five days each.

The names were also originally taken from China, but they did not always match up well with the local climate. 




In Japan, they were eventually rewritten in 1685 by the court astronomer Shibukawa Shunkai.






 In their present form, they offer a poetic journey through the Japanese year in which the land awakens and blooms with life and activity before returning to slumber.

The dates in the following table are approximate and may vary by one day depending on the year.




 There are no standard readings in Japanese for the kanji names of the 72 ko, so other sources may give different readings.
